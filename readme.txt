Using Makefile

1) Navigate to the directory containing the files (all files must be in the same directory) in the terminal
2) Enter the command "make" (no quotes are necessary)
3) Enter the command “./Compile” (again, no quotes). 
	note: the following flags are able to be appended after “./Compile” in any order 	as long as there is whitespace on either side of the flag

	-l: Print the lexeme list to the console	-a: Print the generated assembly code to the console	-v: Print the virtual machine execution trace to the console
